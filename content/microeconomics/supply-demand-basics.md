Markets coordinate millions of individual choices. The supply and demand framework shows how those choices translate into prices and quantities.

## 0) Visual and equation example

![Supply and demand chart](../../homes/images/cost-curves.svg "Supply-demand style visual")

A simple demand equation can be written inline as $Q_d = a - bP$.

$$
Q_d = 100 - 2P \\
Q_s = 20 + 3P \\
Q_d = Q_s \Rightarrow P^* = 16
$$

## 1) The demand curve
Demand is the quantity consumers are willing and able to buy at different prices, *ceteris paribus*.

### Why demand slopes downward
- **Substitution effect:** buyers move toward relatively cheaper goods.
- **Income effect:** lower prices raise purchasing power.
- **Diminishing marginal benefit:** extra units bring less additional value.

### Main demand shifters
- Income
- Preferences
- Prices of related goods
- Expectations
- Number of buyers

---

## 2) The supply curve
Supply is the quantity firms are willing and able to sell at different prices.

### Why supply slopes upward
- Rising marginal cost
- Entry by additional firms
- Resource opportunity cost

### Main supply shifters
- Input prices
- Technology
- Taxes and subsidies
- Number of sellers
- Expectations

## 3) Market equilibrium
Equilibrium is where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.

- If price is **below** equilibrium, a shortage pushes price up.
- If price is **above** equilibrium, a surplus pushes price down.

> **Rule of thumb:** shortage pushes prices up; surplus pushes prices down.

## 4) Elasticity and revenue
Price elasticity describes sensitivity of quantity to price changes.

`Ed = (%ΔQd) / (%ΔP)`

- Elastic demand: `|Ed| > 1`
- Inelastic demand: `|Ed| < 1`
- Unit elastic: `|Ed| = 1`

Total revenue is `TR = P × Q`.

- With **elastic** demand, lower price tends to increase revenue.
- With **inelastic** demand, lower price tends to decrease revenue.

## 5) Policy examples
### Price ceiling
A binding ceiling (below equilibrium) creates a shortage.

### Price floor
A binding floor (above equilibrium) creates a surplus.

## 6) Numerical example
Suppose:
- Demand: `Qd = 100 - 2P`
- Supply: `Qs = 20 + 3P`

Set them equal:

`100 - 2P = 20 + 3P`  
`80 = 5P`  
`P* = 16`

Then:

`Q* = 68`

| Price (P) | Quantity Demanded (Qd) | Quantity Supplied (Qs) | Market status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 80 | 50 | Shortage |
| 16 | 68 | 68 | Equilibrium |
| 25 | 50 | 95 | Surplus |

## 7) Quick recap
- Demand usually slopes down; supply usually slopes up.
- Equilibrium is where `Qd = Qs`.
- Non-price factors shift curves.
- Elasticity helps explain taxes, policy, and revenue outcomes.
