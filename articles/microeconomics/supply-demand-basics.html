  <p>
    Markets coordinate millions of individual choices. The “supply and demand” diagram is the
    compressed model economists use to explain how those choices translate into prices and quantities.
    This note builds the model from the ground up, then stress-tests it with elasticity, policy shocks,
    and real-world frictions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) The demand curve</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Demand</strong> describes how much consumers are willing and able to buy at different prices,
    holding other factors constant (<em>ceteris paribus</em>). A typical demand curve slopes downward:
    as price falls, quantity demanded rises.
  </p>

  <h3>Why does demand slope downward?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Substitution effect:</strong> when a good becomes cheaper relative to substitutes, consumers switch toward it.</li>
    <li><strong>Income effect:</strong> a lower price increases purchasing power, raising desired consumption (for normal goods).</li>
    <li><strong>Diminishing marginal benefit:</strong> additional units generally provide less extra satisfaction than earlier ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Shifters of demand</h3>
  <p>
    A change in price moves you <em>along</em> the demand curve; changes in “shifters” move the
    entire curve.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Income:</strong> normal goods (demand rises with income) vs inferior goods (demand falls with income).</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> tastes, trends, and advertising.</li>
    <li><strong>Prices of related goods:</strong> substitutes and complements.</li>
    <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> expected future prices and incomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Number of buyers:</strong> population, market size.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>2) The supply curve</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Supply</strong> describes how much firms are willing and able to sell at different prices,
    holding other factors constant. Supply typically slopes upward: higher prices make producing
    additional units profitable for more firms and for existing firms at the margin.
  </p>

  <h3>Why does supply slope upward?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rising marginal cost:</strong> beyond some point, extra output requires overtime, less efficient inputs, or capacity strain.</li>
    <li><strong>Entry:</strong> higher prices can attract new firms, increasing market quantity supplied.</li>
    <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> resources shift toward the higher-paying activity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Shifters of supply</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Input prices:</strong> wages, raw materials, energy, rent.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> productivity improvements shift supply right.</li>
    <li><strong>Taxes and subsidies:</strong> per-unit taxes shift supply left; subsidies shift right.</li>
    <li><strong>Number of sellers:</strong> entry and exit.</li>
    <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> about future costs and prices.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural conditions:</strong> weather, disruptions, geopolitical events.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>3) Market equilibrium</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Equilibrium</strong> is the price–quantity pair where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.
    At the equilibrium price, the market has no built-in pressure for price to change.
  </p>

  <h3>Shortage vs surplus</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>If price is below equilibrium:</strong> quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied → <em>shortage</em> → upward pressure on price.</li>
    <li><strong>If price is above equilibrium:</strong> quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded → <em>surplus</em> → downward pressure on price.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can think of price as the signal and quantity as the outcome:
    market participants respond to the signal until their plans align.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> “Shortage pushes prices up. Surplus pushes prices down.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <hr>

  <h2>4) Comparative statics: shifts and new equilibria</h2>
  <p>
    Comparative statics asks: if something changes (income, costs, taxes, preferences), where do we
    land after the market adjusts?
  </p>

  <h3>Demand increases (shift right)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Price:</strong> tends to rise</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> tends to rise</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supply decreases (shift left)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Price:</strong> tends to rise</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> tends to fall</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Both shift at once</h3>
  <p>
    When both demand and supply shift, one of the two outcomes (price or quantity) can become ambiguous
    without more information. A useful technique is to shift one curve at a time, drawing the new
    intersection.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>5) Elasticity: how sensitive are buyers and sellers?</h2>
  <p>
    Elasticity measures responsiveness: “If price changes by 1%, how much does quantity change (in %)?”
    It helps predict how prices and quantities respond to shocks and it is central for tax incidence.
  </p>

  <h3>Price elasticity of demand</h3>
  <p>
    The (point) price elasticity of demand is:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>Ed = (%ΔQd) / (%ΔP)</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Demand is usually negative-sloped, so <code>Ed</code> is typically negative; economists often discuss
    elasticity in absolute value.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Elastic demand:</strong> |Ed| &gt; 1 → quantity responds more than price</li>
    <li><strong>Inelastic demand:</strong> |Ed| &lt; 1 → quantity responds less than price</li>
    <li><strong>Unit elastic:</strong> |Ed| = 1</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What makes demand more elastic?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>More and closer substitutes</li>
    <li>More time to adjust (long run &gt; short run)</li>
    <li>Larger share of the budget</li>
    <li>Luxury vs necessity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Price elasticity of supply</h3>
  <p>
    <code>Es = (%ΔQs) / (%ΔP)</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Supply tends to be more elastic in the long run, when firms can expand capacity, re-optimize inputs,
    and new firms can enter.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6) Total revenue and elasticity</h2>
  <p>
    Total revenue is <code>TR = P × Q</code>. Whether a price cut increases or decreases revenue depends on
    demand elasticity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>If demand is <strong>elastic</strong>, lowering price increases TR (quantity rises a lot).</li>
    <li>If demand is <strong>inelastic</strong>, lowering price decreases TR (quantity rises a little).</li>
    <li>If demand is <strong>unit elastic</strong>, TR is roughly unchanged.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is why firms in markets with few substitutes (e.g., certain utilities) can raise prices with
    limited quantity loss, while competitive retail markets often cannot.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7) Policies: price ceilings and price floors</h2>

  <h3>Price ceiling (maximum legal price)</h3>
  <p>
    A binding ceiling set below equilibrium creates a shortage. Non-price rationing mechanisms often
    appear: waiting lines, quality reduction, informal markets, or favoritism in allocation.
  </p>

  <h3>Price floor (minimum legal price)</h3>
  <p>
    A binding floor set above equilibrium creates a surplus. The textbook example is a wage floor:
    if set above the market-clearing wage, it can create excess labor supply.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>Key distinction:</strong> A policy “binds” only if it is set on the “wrong side” of equilibrium.
      Otherwise, it has no effect on the market outcome.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <hr>

  <h2>8) Taxes: who really pays?</h2>
  <p>
    A per-unit tax drives a wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive. The
    division of the burden is called <strong>tax incidence</strong> and depends on elasticities:
    the side of the market that is <em>less</em> elastic bears more of the tax.
  </p>

  <h3>Intuition</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If demand is very inelastic (buyers “must” buy), buyers bear most of the tax.</li>
    <li>If supply is very inelastic (sellers can’t easily change output), sellers bear most of the tax.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is why taxes on cigarettes are often passed to consumers (relatively inelastic demand), while
    taxes in highly competitive, flexible markets may be shared more evenly.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>9) A small numerical example (for layout testing)</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose demand and supply are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Demand: <code>Qd = 100 - 2P</code></li>
    <li>Supply: <code>Qs = 20 + 3P</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Equilibrium occurs when <code>Qd = Qs</code>:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>100 - 2P = 20 + 3P</code><br>
    <code>80 = 5P</code><br>
    <code>P* = 16</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Then quantity is:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>Q* = 100 - 2(16) = 68</code>
  </p>

  <h3>Table (to test your CSS)</h3>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Price (P)</th>
        <th>Quantity Demanded (Qd)</th>
        <th>Quantity Supplied (Qs)</th>
        <th>Market Status</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>80</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>Shortage</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>68</td>
        <td>68</td>
        <td>Equilibrium</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>95</td>
        <td>Surplus</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>10) Real-world complications</h2>
  <p>
    The supply–demand model is powerful, but real markets include frictions:
  </p>

  <h3>Market power</h3>
  <p>
    If a firm has pricing power (monopoly or oligopoly), price is not purely set by intersection of
    anonymous curves; strategy, differentiation, and entry barriers matter.
  </p>

  <h3>Search and information costs</h3>
  <p>
    Consumers don’t always instantly observe prices and qualities. Comparison shopping takes time, and
    firms can price discriminate when information is imperfect.
  </p>

  <h3>Externalities</h3>
  <p>
    When a transaction affects third parties (pollution, network effects), the private equilibrium can
    differ from the socially efficient outcome.
  </p>

  <h3>Sticky prices and adjustment lags</h3>
  <p>
    In some markets, prices adjust slowly because of contracts, menu costs, or coordination issues. In
    those cases, quantities may do more of the adjusting in the short run.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Quick recap</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Demand slopes down; supply slopes up (typically).</li>
    <li>Equilibrium is where Qd = Qs; deviations create shortage/surplus pressures.</li>
    <li>Shifts come from non-price factors (income, costs, technology, expectations).</li>
    <li>Elasticities determine sensitivity, revenue effects, and tax incidence.</li>
    <li>Policy constraints (ceilings/floors) bind only if set beyond equilibrium.</li>
    <li>Real markets include power, frictions, externalities, and delays.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <em>Next note idea:</em> use the same framework to analyze how a supply shock (e.g., energy prices)
    can propagate through multiple related markets (transport, food, services) via input costs.
